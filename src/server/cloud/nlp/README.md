# Intro

A Google Cloud Function to detect an intent on the `adaptive-trader` DialogFlow.


## Natural Language Process (NLP)

NLP interprets and executes tasks based on natural language commands expressed by the user. It leverages the capabilities of NLP algorithms and models to understand the user's input, extract relevant information, and take the necessary actions on their behalf.

The search engine supports a wide range of commands.
Here are a few examples:

```
How is the currency market?
Show me all Fx prices?
What does the market look like?
What does FX look like?

How is Cable doing?
Price EURUSD
Quote EURUSD
Spot EURUSD
What is the current EURUSD rate?

Buy USDGBP 10M
SellÂ 20M JPYUSD

Show market
Show me my last 5 trades
Show me my last GBPUSD trades
What were my last 5 JPY trades
```
